## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process

I started this project as the final year project for my Bachelors Degree, I did my initial research to find a market with a lack of automation of tasks and found the subscription market to be the right pick for this project, as there are no other apps that provides these features together.

Next, I planned out what features I should have for this product, and landed with building a platform that includeds an admin and vendor dashboard, and a mobile app, with features such as cohesive entity management, personalized recommendations and community features.

I then researched about the technologies i should use for this platform, and landed on building an end to end typesafe application using typescript on all three ends, backend, `NextJS` frontend and `React Native` mobile app, collocated with `Turborepo`.

I was able to conclude development within three months while working and studying at for the final year.

I was able to use this project as my internship assignment project, which helped me get permanent from my internship.

Along the way, while building everything i documented the process as it was necessary for my final year report.

In the end I was able to use this project to get a job and get an `A` for the final year project :]

## üìö What I Learned

During this project, I learned about running a structured and well documented project.

### Turborepo:

- This is my first time building a project with a monorepo like `Turborepo`.
- It came with a bunch of issues with pnpm but i was able to get through them.

### React Native:

- This is also my first time using `Expo` `React Native`.
- I was using an early version of `Expo Router` as that was the latest back then, which came with a few quirks, but i was able to get through then.

## üí≠ How can it be improved?

- Add automated product scraping.
- Add localization with more currencies.
- Improve performance on the mobile app.
- Update Expo router to the latest version, which should fix some of the quirks.
- Add dark mode for the mobile app.
- Add light mode for the dashboard.

## üö¶ Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `pnpm i` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `pnpm dev` to get all projects running, but you are required to provide the necessary enviorment variables.

Running the project maybe complex due to the nature of turborepo, contact me for any clarification.
